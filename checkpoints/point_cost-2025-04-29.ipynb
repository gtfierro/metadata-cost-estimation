We are not interested in the capital expenses here. The value proposition of metadata is to reduce the labor costs by automating configuration and discovery of points (among other metadata). **TODO: need to find a way of estimating the *labor-only* per-point cost.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions in the Labor Cost Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Scope of $T_{build}$**: We assume $T_{build}$ primarily covers the creation of the building's structural metadata model (e.g., system-zone relationships, equipment hierarchy) and does *not* include the tagging of the individual points (this is in $T_{tag}$)\n",
    "2.  **Application-Specific Point Work ($T_{tag}$)**: The time $T_{tag}$ is assumed to be incurred for all $P_{c,i}$ points required by each application $i$ on each equipment instance of class $c$. This covers the effort to ensure each point has the specific tags or metadata attributes required by that particular application, which might involve adding new tags, refining existing ones, or verifying them against the application's requirements.\n",
    "3.  **Interpretation of $T_{fix}$**: The parameter $T_{fix}$ (Time to fix a point) is applied to all $P_{c,i}$ points for each application. This interpretation implies that $T_{fix}$ is an *average time* spent on fixing-related activities per point considered for an application. This effectively bundles the probability of a point needing a fix and the actual time to perform a fix into a single average value applied to all points being processed for an application. For example, if 10% of points typically require a fix, and a fix takes 10 minutes, the average $T_{fix}$ per point would be 1 minute.\n",
    "4.  **Rule Finding ($T_{find}$)**: $T_{find}$ is the time to select rules for an entire equipment *class*. This effort is performed once for each unique equipment class in $C$.\n",
    "5.  **Homogeneity of Instances**: It's assumed that all $N_c$ instances of a given equipment class $c$ run the same $A_c$ applications, and each application $i$ requires the same number of points $P_{c,i}$ on any instance of that class."
